Step 4. Double-click where you want to insert the new content of another web page.

Step 5. Enter the URL of the page you want to extract the content. If the search is based on text from the original page, copy the text. Click on the button "GO AHEAD!"

Step 6. Perform the necessary actions to find the desired content (BEAUD will save them). Once found this content, select it and double-click.
